  Four schools in Cape Town, Die Duine Primary, Mzamomtsha Primary, Rondebosch Boys Prep and our school, #ChristelHouseSA​ enjoyed a fun-filled, yet productive #DerbyDay​ at our school on 14 Nov.</p></b>


    <b><p>Twenty Grade 6 students from each school enjoyed a festive, productive day at Christel House. Students participated in ice breaker games, deep conversations, exercises and an exciting go-kart race that allowed students to interact and bond with each other.</b></p>
    <b><p>According to the World Bank, an international foundation, South Africa is one of the most unequitable countries in the world. Their aim is to reduce wealth inequality. That is why the foundation is supporting Christel House in forging partnerships between wealthy and underprivileged schools, developing joint activities and curriculum to reduce the gap between the South African youth.
    </b></p>
    <b><p>Even though these students come from very different backgrounds, they managed to meet on equal ground to work together, bond, share ideas and enjoy fun activities.

  <b><p>Thank you to our generous international donor for helping us create opportunities for students to collaborate.
